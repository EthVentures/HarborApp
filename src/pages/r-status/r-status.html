      YOUR APPLICATION - US RESETTELMENT
    </ion-list-header>
    <ion-card>
      <p padding>
        Resettlement is considered a durable solution for refugees who cannot return to their countries of origin or integrate into the current countries that are hosting them. Resettlement to a country like the United States presents a life-saving alternative for a very small number of refugees around the world (less than one half of one percent). Refugees seeking resettlement in the United States must pass through a series of steps aimed at ensuring they will not pose a security risk to the United States.

      STEP 1 - REFUGEE STATUS CONFIRMED
    </ion-list-header>
    <ion-card>
      <p padding>
        The UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) registers individuals and collects identifying documents, biographic information, and biometric data (such as an iris scan for Syrians).  In most cases, UNHCR interviews the applicant to determine if the individual qualifies as a refugee under international law.

      STEP 2 – Referral to the United States
    </ion-list-header>
    <ion-card>
      <p padding>
 refugee who meets one of the criteria for resettlement in the United States is referred to the government by UNHCR, a U.S. Embassy, or a trained Non-Governmental Organization.  Under legislation passed by Congress, Iraqi nationals who have worked for the U.S. government, a U.S. contractor, or a U.S.-based media organization or NGO, and their family members, as well as Iraqis with family members in the U.S., can apply directly to the U.S. resettlement program without being referred by UNHCR.  After referral, the screening process takes 18 to 24 months.

      STEP 3 – Resettlement Support Center
    </ion-list-header>
    <ion-card>
      <p padding>
A Resettlement Support Center (RSC), contracted by the U.S. Department of State (DOS), conducts an interview and compiles the refugee’s personal data and background information for the security clearance process and the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) in-person interview.

      STEP 4 – Security Screening
    </ion-list-header>
    <ion-card>
      <p padding>
DOS runs the names of all refugees referred to the United States for resettlement through the Consular Lookout and Support System (CLASS), which contains watch-list information. f USCIS finds certain criteria to be met, the case is referred to the agency’s Fraud Detection and National Security Division (FDNS) for further review.  This review includes open-source and classified research which is compiled into a report for use by the USCIS interviewing officer.

      STEP 5 – USCIS In-person Interview
    </ion-list-header>
    <ion-card>
      <p padding>
 A highly trained USCIS officer will travel to the refugee’s location overseas to conduct a detailed, face-to-face interview with the applicant as well as accompanying family over age 14.  The officer evaluates the applicant’s credibility and considers whether his or her testimony is consistent with country conditions.  Based on the interview and the refugee’s case file, the officer will determine whether the individual qualifies as a refugee and is otherwise admissible under U.S. law.

      STEP 6 – Approval
    </ion-list-header>
    <ion-card>
      <p padding>
If the necessary criteria are met, the USCIS officer will conditionally approve the refugee’s application for resettlement and submit it to DOS for final processing.  Conditional approvals become final once the results of all security checks (Steps 4-7, 10) and the medical screening (Step 11) have been received and cleared.
