HarborApp
=========
Harbor allows government agencies and nonprofit entities to incentivize behavior that leads to more successful refugee resettlements. With blockchain identities established, aid workers are able to easily reward refugees for completing language classes, job training workshops, and weekly check-ins, among other things.
